The unfinished client implementation of the Archipelago randomizer for Mages of Mystralia. Uploading here in case anyone wants to take a look at it, maybe continue working on it as I'm no longer interested.

Sorry, I'm not a programmer and I don't really know how to use github (git? what's the difference? i think there is one), I hope I uploaded all the files correctly.
